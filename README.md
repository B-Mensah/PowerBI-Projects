<ins>**AdventureWorks Report:**</ins>

AdventureWorks is a company that sells products for those who enjoy outdoor activities. This report I created can help the company track core business **KPIs**(sales, revenue, profit, returns), **compare regional performance**, **analyse product-level trends and forecast**, and also **identify high valued customers**.

This report consists of an **Executive Summary**, which showcases orders by category and subcategory, an enabled drill-through feature which allows users to select products and find detailed information such as return volume and future profit forecast. A map which allows users to choose which continent theyâ€™re interested in and several KPI cards labelling monthly orders, revenue and returns. This report also contains an in-depth **Product Detail** page and a **Customer Detail** page.



<ins>**Maven Market Report:**</ins> 

Maven Market is a multinational grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. I performed the task of connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, adding calculated columns and measures, and designing a report using different visuals. This report will help the company to **track KPIs**(Transactions, Profit, Returns), **understand the performance for each brand** and **compare regional performance**.

This report consists of a **Topline Performance** summary, which consists of a matrix table that displays the product brand, total transactions, profit, profit margin and return rate so that users can understand the performance for each brand. I added a Treemap to display the total transactions by country, state and city so that users can compare performance between them . A stacked column chart was inserted to display the weekly revenue to understand the revenue trend. Furthermore, I added a Gauge chart to display revenue vs. target so that users can see which product exceed the intended target. Lastly, I added three KPI cards, which showcases current monthly transaction, total profit and revenue so that users can easily access this important information. 

On the second page of the report, I inserted three bookmarks based on insights I found from the first page so that when users click the bookmark, they will see the present configured view of a report page, with the fiters and visuals.
